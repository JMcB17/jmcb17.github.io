# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    solutions: The namesake of the website. When I can't find a solution to a problem on the web, I'll post it here, like one-sided stackoverflow. <https://xkcd.com/979/>
    assets: Random assets I want to share, like github gists but for miscellaneous .psd files.
    releases: A digestible feed of projects I'm working on that I want to share, so you don't have to trawl through my repositories and commits etc.
    blog: uncategorised posts are just general blog posts.
