Spotify on Windows (I assume Mac and Linux are the same) does have gapless playback but it's pretty well hidden away. Here's how to activate it.

1. Open spotify yes

2. Open Settings

5. Enable 'Crossfade songs', but set it to 0 sec. This is the same as gapless playback. Spotify has no setting named 'gapless', which is what made it hard to find.

Gapless playback is an essential feature considering that it was the default on old media like vinyl. Many musicians at the time took advantage of it to add detail to their albums - like the Beetles with tracks 11, 12, and 13 of Abbey Road - and some today continue the tradition, like Neil Cicierega with much of his work. It's a travesty that VLC on Android still doesn't have it. Thanks for reading.
