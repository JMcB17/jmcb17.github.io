## Summary

- Set start directory in Settings/Directory/File Browser
- Install Core
- Set controller overlay in Settings/On-Screen Display/On-Screen Overlay/Overlay Preset
- Use the Flat overlays, they work much better as far as I know (for NES)
- If you can't use save states it might be because you enabled Acheivements/Hardcore Mode
