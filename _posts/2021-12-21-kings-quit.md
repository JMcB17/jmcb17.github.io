## Introduction

This article has been a fair undertaking and is currently a work in progress. I'm going to add sections about my research, some background, and a way I'm working on to make the mod easier to distribute, and even customisable. For now, enjoy this comprehensive guide to setting up the glitch in its simplest form.

## Solution

To play King's Quit you need any normal release of the 1991 multimedia version, and the audio resource file from the obscure 1995 SierraOriginals release. The SierraOriginals version is the *only* version with the unique audio resource file which makes the glitch work.

I've sourced and mirrored these files so that you can download them easily. The total download size is about 200MB. I'm currently personally seeding the torrent files if you want faster download from archive.org.

### Normal 1991 version

    My mirror removes the original audio file, as you will be replacing it. This reduces the download size by about 50MB.
