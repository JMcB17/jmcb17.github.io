# The Guerrilla Education Manifesto

## The sacred duty of the Educator, the Documentator, and the Archivist

Everything that happens is a natural result of previous things - the process of cause and effect. Humanity hasn't just evolved from monkeys, it has also had a massive amount of cultural evolution. If everyone on Earth were to forget everything they know tomorrow, society would be changed. We would be left to re-learn everything from whatever we've written down.

When a teacher passes on knowledge to their students, they are creating the next generation of society. This is a process that happens naturally, by socialisation, but we can also try to create systems that pass on knowledge as well as possible.

When a person teaches, they often forget what it's like to learn. A lot of the academic world is more concerned with having fun amongst themselves than with passing on the baton of the profession as smoothly as possible to the new recruits who will replace them.

I believe that more effort should be put into reforming terminology and teaching methods from the point of view of a new student. We must build systems of understanding and teaching that are effective but easy to pick up. For example, even if renaming theorems or chemical compounds is a hassle for established mathematicians and chemists, the benefit for learners outweighs the effort.

Even the most experienced people are in a constant process of learning. Many great advancements have been made by students, often working with their tutors. The discovery of brand new information happens as a natural part of the process by which we teach known information to people who aren't aware of it yet.

History is constantly being produced. Some of the most significant historical texts, such as Samuel Pepys' diary, would have been unassuming to their creators or other people of the time. From a "longtermist" perspective, we should focus on organising existing historical knowledge, as well as relevant cultural knowledge, into efficient databases. I expect the "wiki" model will have a big impact on the field of history, as well as other fields.

# The failures of other movements

This is the inevitable part of my manifesto where I spend my time complaining about other people who I mostly agree with.

Marxist-Leninists failed by attempting to pre-empt the progression of society. Their "Vanguard Party of the Revolution" doctrine casted them as saviours who would take their understanding of socio-economics and impose it on the human race by military force.

Unfortunately, complex problems cannot have simple solutions, as a rule. Even if their desires to create a more fair world were valid, the systems they managed to create - the "Soviet Union" and the "People's Republic of China" - were not good.

Continental Philosophers fail by making everything more complicated than it needs to be. They retreat into millions upon millions of words of very fancy sounding language. They might be having fun, but they aren't really helping to change anything.

# Emotion and Reason

Human beings are emotional creatures, whether we like it or not. Rationality is our invention, but it doesn't necessarily come naturally to us.

Some Thinkers will try to remove emotion from science and philosophy altogether. They try to act like the Vulcans (Mr. Spock) from Star Trek, try to become pure and unquestionable Knight-Philosophers of Reason. Unfortunately, this seems to result in making arguments just as emotionally charged as others, but with more misplaced confidence.

In my opinion, the best way to good outcomes is to stay humble and to follow the scientific method. The scientific method, like most things, is really incredibly simple in hindsight. "If you want to say something is true, check if it is true. (Then, whenever you get new information, check again. Repeat as many times as needed.)" Somehow, it took us tens of thousands of years to develop this method of *Empirical Falsifiability*.

I think there are two reasons for this. One, it's hard to follow this method when you have absolutely no clue what to do to test an idea. We had to muddle around with mercury and sulphur in tubes, whenever we found the free time to do it, until we eventually stumbled on some good ideas.

Two, because we didn't write things down enough. Now we have computers and the internet, the most effective machines for writing, typesetting, storing, and transmitting information ever invented, it's inevitable we'll be able to do better.

Basically, let your emotions guide you - emotions like love of other people and hatred of injustice - and when your emotions don't line up with reality, use reason to guide them.

# The role of comedy in politics

**Content warning for this section: war, death, medical science, nuclear catastrophe, climate disaster, hate crimes**

Politics fucking sucks. People everywhere are hurting and dying. Soldiers bleed out in trenches. People are denied medical care and, in the course of trying to go about their day, lose their grip on consciousness and fall down to never wake up again. People in innocent marginalised groups are routinely abused, made to feel awful, and, in extreme cases, beaten and stabbed to death.

Around the world there are hundreds of space rockets, magnificent works of engineering, turned to a twisted purpose. They carry bombs. Put together, all of these bombs are enough to blanket the surface of the entire planet multiple times over, and wipe out 99% of all plant and animal life. 

In this theoretical scenario, the survivors would be ridden with melted eyeballs, burns, chronic radiation syndrome, and other horrible injuries. They would eventually be able to rebuild, but it would take a thousand years of darkness. The only thing keeping us from this scenario is a process of checks and balances, big red buttons, and turned keys, a process, unfortunately, also designed by humans.

I understand it poorly, but I know that the people at the highest levels of power in this process are people like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, mad people who already send thousands to their deaths.

Besides this theoretical scenario, atrocity on the scale of the entire Planet Earth is already happening. A rise in overall heat, leading to extreme high temperatures, low temperatures, and other dreadful weather effects, has already happened. It will take us decades to reverse this process in a best-case scenario.

The point is, politics is awful. To cope with this, many turn to ignorance and denial, or euphemism. "I don't know what you're talking about, I'm just not really a political person". "Climate change isn't happening at all". "Climate change will sort itself out". "Black people deserve to be enslaved, they are inferior". "Women who get raped are simply asking for it".  People use phrases like "National Security" and "The Economy". 

Even when they acknowledge tragedies that happen, people simply decide that nothing can be done, and try to get on with their lives. But this is false. Things have got better, and they will continue to get better. Unfortunately, the first step to tackling a problem is to acknowledge it exists. You have to get a good look at the problem, understand it, and accept that it is real. Accept the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

When each of us is born, we are plunged into the universe as a whole, and deeper, into the Great Machine of Society. In this machine we are all cogs, wheels, pipes, wires, regulators, and other assorted doodads. No one chooses to be in this machine, but if we are lucky, we find a part of it we love, with other people we love, doing what we were made to do. But staring out at the Great Machine of Society in its current state is like looking at Cthulhu - you go insane.

All of this, and half the time, when you try to talk about it with anyone else, you just get into an argument over your preconceptions. People treat politics like a sports game of Political Party 1 versus Political Party 2, and if you really care about politics, you're seen as a weirdly devoted sports fan.

Thankfully we have a bunch of coping mechanisms we can find to use. One of my favourite ones is comedy. Even if the issues are very serious, making light of them can make them much more tolerable. Also, fascists always want to be taken seriously, with their flat, grey, Hugo Boss uniforms and their goose-stepping. If we treat the whole of politics as the joke that it is, we can speak truth to power more effectively.

# The Manifesto

In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx defined the goal of Communism as "the abolition of private property". This was apparently the best he could do. I propose a new, universal, almost irreducible goal for Worldwide Communism:

> Full human rights for every human being, without exception.
>
> This means every right, from the more well-defined ones to the vaguer ones - food, water, clean air, shelter, hygiene, healthcare, dignity, respect, work, freedom of movement, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from violence, freedom of love, creativity.
>
> These rights must be provided to every human being, utterly without exception - regardless of age, sex, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, disability, neuro-divergence, where you were born, personality.
>
> This state of affairs is both necessary and fully achievable.

Of course, I also believe in rights for other animals, and even plant life. In a really good world, it shouldn't be that hard to provide those rights too.

The rights provided should cover the whole of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and beyond. They must be provided regardless of whether you're rich or poor, although that concept, as we understand it now, doesn't really need to exist at all. Human rights must be provided regardless of whether you're a criminal or have done something wrong. To the best of my knowledge, crime can basically be sorted into two categories - what you're driven to do, and mistakes you make.

No one will be driven to mug you for your purse if no one is lacking money to buy food and pay rent. People will always still make mistakes, but we can build a kind society where people care for one another, and everyone is told about the best known methods to stay safe and protect others. Volunteer peacekeepers can help guide drunk partygoers home and break up fights - like police officers, but very different to the power-tripping pigs who are all too common.

Even the rulers and enforcers who are oppressing humanity right now have to be provided rights, so far as that doesn't stop us from freeing others. Guillotines are fun symbolism, but all life has value, even the lives of those who don't value life.

The abolition of private property is a highly likely to be a required step. We have to try whatever is necessary to accomplish this - regulated capitalism, democratic socialism, minarchism, anarchism, libertarian socialism, state communism, collectivism, syndicalism - voting, peaceful protest, riots, reading groups, armed revolution and mutual aid. We will apply the scientific method, common sense, spontaneous, natural kindness for one another, and centuries of hard work to build the best society possible.

The names of ideologies are descriptive, not prescriptive. I do not know what the future will hold, but I know that it will be beautiful.

# Guerrilla Education

How do we make any of this happen?

I think the only way is for everyone to understand it. Once a majority of people understand politics, it will be impossible to stop goodness from happening. There are too many homeless people, but also far too many empty homes. Poverty is a policy decision.

This principle can be called Class Consciousness. However, it is often overlooked in favour of trying to rush through angry political upheaval. The road to a good world will be long and bumpy.

So, everyone needs to understand politics. At the moment, this knowledge is mostly restricted to nutjobs like me who make it their hobby or their profession. There must be no more telling people to read Marx. Political education should be spread in the most accessible but comprehensive forms possible. No oversimplifications (four legs good, two legs bad...) but also no stupidly long and wordy books.

In fact, Marx wrote that "The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living." Literature is dead, once it is written down and finished, but society and the ideas that drive it are alive. Karl would have probably thought it was pretty funny how people still cling to the written word of his ideas.

Since Communism was first thought of it has been spreading. In the 1900s, we tried to put it into place, and old men clinging onto their inherited power, plus naturally scared people fighting change, did their best to stop it. The rulers of the world have done their best to mislead and to propagandise us, to keep us in the dark. Comprehensive political education will almost never be put into place in primary or secondary schools, in mandatory education, because of the conflict of interest. The rulers of the world will never just tell you how to get your freedom, let alone give it to you. In fact, they won't even tell you you're not already free.

But the revolutionary spirit is higher than ever. My generation was born and raised in a world with little hope. Nearly everyone can recognise the fundamental brokenness in society. We demand change. Fascism happens because we know something has to give but we don't know what. If "Communism has already failed and will never work", maybe getting rid of the Jews or the Transes will fix something?

But hatred can never persevere. It is not natural nor is it healthy to hate so much. We have to offer real solutions that will work. The time will come to be communist in public again. Stand on the street like a Jehovah's Witness and tell people (as far as the law allows, or further if you have nothing to lose). Show people [*Why Socialism?* by Albert Einstein](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/) - appeal to authority is always good. Hold classes in political science and philosophy in parks or whatever rooms you can book. Tell your family and friends. Above all, be kind to one another. Don't talk down to people for not understanding things. No one understands anything without it being taught to them, and bad, deeply held ideas are rife. Don't make spreading political education your entire personality, because it's unsustainable and unhelpful to the cause as well as yourself. Bear with each other and love one another.

Video essayists, I urge you to give up some of your artistic integrity. You don't *just* have to make videos on obscure TV shows, you know. Political opponents will call you a communist whether or not you say it out loud. You don't just have to make videos refuting bad ideas. Spread good ideas and explain them as clearly as possible.

Make videos and make radio shows and podcasts and fiction. Compromise your short term career for the long term good of all mankind. Most people now have phones in their hands that they can use to record, edit, and publish ideas for free. The obstacle is now to cut through the nonsense being made. Let others educate you, educate yourself, and educate others.

# Avoiding hypocrisy

Thomas Jefferson and his co-authors wrote this:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

They wrote this and would not abolish slavery for another 89 years. The country they founded is now itself one of the greatest forces of oppression in the world, at the same time as it is a force of freedom. Being a hypocrite is inevitable. When others are wrong, set them straight. When you are wrong, try to understand how you are wrong, and try to change. When power is wrong, dismantle it and build it back better.

# Not everyone has to care

Marx sat happily in his office doing opium with his best bud Angle and wrote about how pretty much every human being is oppressed. The people who best understand politics are often the privileged people who have lots of free time and resources to study it.

I think the fact of the matter is that most people are just doing ok. In a society with an unfathomably large number of people (8,000,000,000 at the time of writing), there will be an unfathomably large number of people who are suffering. But most of the people are just ok.

The important part is to help all of the people who are suffering, while harming the average person as little as possible. We can take the super-rich people who are not suffering at all and burn their yachts too if we want. Finally, when we build a good society for everyone, everyone will benefit, not just the people who are currently in poverty, but everyone. I firmly believe that even the current rulers of the world would be happier in a world where they have happy people all around them, instead of gold-plated caviar made and delivered by unhappy people.
