<!-- # It's Time to Start Being Honest About Capitalism -->

Capitalism is about to collapse. More and more people are waking up to this fact: it's inevitable. Capitalism as a way of organising society, is a system of constant growth, that is no longer sustainable. Ask a person on the street (where I live at least, in the UK) and they'll be more than likely to agree with this. Sometimes, criticising capitalism will have you met with jeers and mockery - mostly if you're in a social group with more privileged people - but by and large, the arguments made by anticapitalists are undeniable.

Herein lies the problem: what's the alternative to capitalism? Ask an anticapitalist what they think the solution is. They'll probably be much less confident in their solutions than in their analysis of the problems. Now here's the kicker: the solution to Capitalism is Communism. This much is obvious. If not Communism, then something resembling Communism, Socialism, or Anarchism; probably with a Democratic bent.

This is so obvious as a belief system, in fact, that it was inaugurated about 158 years ago, with the foundation of the International Workingmen's Association on the 28th September 1864, in London. At the inaugural meeting of this organisation was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, as well as the much more well-known Karl Marx. Now Mr. Marx didn't know the future, because no one does, but most of his predictions have held up incredibly well. Karl Marx can easily be considered among the greatest philosophers of recent history, maybe even the greatest philosophers of all time. This brings me to my next point "Why don't people respect Karl Marx"?

## Partisanship

I recently read an issue of *Philosophy Now* which had a lot of rubbish articles and one on Karl Marx. This one article was the only mention of Marx in the entire paper. It was a childish takedown, written by a racist. Not exactly befitting the stature of a "respectable" magazine, or a great thinker like Marx. I'm now going to reveal the true title of this article: "It's Time to Start Being Honest About Communism".

So here's what I think is the reason why people don't respect Karl Marx: Partisanship. Marx and his ilk had a lot of ideas, some of them good, some of them bad, but all of them were utterly terrifying to the rulers of the time, and they still terrify the rulers of the world today. For this reason they have been systemically suppressed by propaganda, both natural and intentional propaganda (Chomsky, 1988). I think it's time for society as a whole to wake up to the truth of communism.

Unfortunately, communist political parties are basically nonexistent in Euroamerica at the moment. The utter disgrace of the Soviet Union, and the "war" that took place between it and the USA, provided perfect ammunition for the systematic suppression of communist ideas. This is why there are no communist political parties. Recently, the respectable UK liberal party Labour elected a new party leader named Jeremy Corbyn. He had a lot of excellent policy ideas which sparked a huge wave of political enfranchisement, especially in younger people. The USA had an equivalent, Bernard Sanders. Unfortunately they were systematically derided in the mainstream media (even "leftist" media) for such sins as riding "Mao-style bicycles \[sic\]". This is the greatest "Cancel Culture" that exists in our society - it's no longer ok to be a communist.

So what do we do now? I think it's time for communists to come out of the woodwork en masse. Tens of thousands of people around the world are still hardcore believers in communism, with millions or even billions more ready to turn as soon as the spark is lit. It's time for every left-leaning person around the world to stand up and shout "I am a Communist!" The Internet provides the means for us to organise this action. I propose a date of 2023-05-01, the First of May. Once we declare our allegiance and bring communism into the public eye again, millions will join us. This is the strategy that the LGBT+ community invented with the Stonewall Rebellion: We're here, we're Queer, Put up with it. It's time for leftists to declare: We're here, we're Communist, Put up with it.

The Plan
1. Tweet "#IamACommunist"
    This is the least you can do. Most people have a Twitter account already and if you don't have one already you can make one for free in five  minutes. You can also post the same message on any other platform, or even yell it out in public if you have no self consciousness.
2. Arrange public demonstrations
    This part is key. Online demonstration is something, but also, twitter is bullshit. In-person demonstrations will be the most important part for the movement. Every left-learning organisation in the world should begin planning public protests for the 1st of May
3. Get ready to vote

There is no other way we can win. Appealing to the moderate right has been an absolute failure: the press calls us communist, the moderates recognise that communism is bad, and fall back in line, voting for "sensible" parties. Once we declare our allegiance to Communism and Worldwide Human Rights, the press will be forced to fall in line for once.
