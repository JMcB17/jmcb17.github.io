## Introduction

### Glossary
- low-level, [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language): the level of abstraction. Machine code like `00110111101101011111010000110110`[^1] is lower level than Python like `print('hello world')`. Higher-level code is generally slower, and easier to understand for humans.

### Numbered Criteria
- speed: how fast does it run?
- readability: how easy is it to read the source code?
- writability: how emjoyable is it to write the source code?
- [ubiquity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ubiquitous#English): how widely used is it?
- applications: range of applications - how many different kinds of program can you write with it?

## The list

1. Rust

    Rust is a new and massively up-and-coming language. It's a low-level language that's more memory-safe, and safe in general (it's much harder to create very dangerous undetected bugs), faster, and far more modern than C.

    - speed: 5/5
    - readability: 4/5
    - writeability: 4/5
    - ubiquity: 2/5
    - applications: 3/5
