## Introduction

### Glossary
- low-level, [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language): the level of abstraction. Machine code like `101010101011101010`[^1] is lower level than Python like `print('hello world')`. Higher-level code is generally slower, and easier to understand for humans.

### Numbered Criteria
- speed: how fast does it run?
- readability: how easy is it to read the source code?
- writability: how emjoyable is it to write the source code?
- [ubiquity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ubiquitous#English): how widely used is it?
- range of applications: how many different kinds of program can you write with it?
